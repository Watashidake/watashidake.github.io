	<h1>Poem : The Call</h1>
	<p><pre>
        It was a hot and sunny summer day; I locked myself away no work for me today

One hour, two hours has past I wondered how long this would last

I sat on the floor picked up a leaf and began to read it very fast

It was a psalm of David which speaks of his horrible sin, deep distress and agony

Suddenly I realized it was my own sin, deep distress and agony that had me locked away

I then began to understand that on the cross Jesus was made the target of that same agony for my sins not his own

Understanding the agony helps me to understand something of the greatness of His love that sends Him to the cross – for me

This day in the stillness of the room I heard a call; It was a mighty powerful voice that calls me by my name; but then I thought could this be my brother’s game

I ran to the window but no one was there, I looked up above the sky was as clear as the ocean

Then I heard that call again, with tones so still and so clear. It draws with power yet sweet and unknown.

My heart began to pound and my tears were falling fast; how long, how long will this last

Yes, yes it is His voice; no other sound could move my heart like this

Then with a stern yet sweetly sound He whispered in my ear, my child, serve me or you will die

O yes tis true, my spirit did awake to life and peace through which it grew under his loving care

Dear Lord thou did speak, it was your call that led my heart to Thee, it drew me to make a better choice and grace has set me free
